# ELEC462 (Spring 2025) – Team Project Showcase

Welcome to the official showcase of selected final team projects from **ELEC462 – System Programming**, taught at **Kyungpook National University** in the Spring 2025 semester.

In this course, students gained hands-on experience with system-level programming in C, covering key topics such as:

- File I/O and system calls (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`, `stat`, etc.)
- Process creation and management using `fork`, `exec`, `wait`, and `exit`
- Terminal-based interface development using the `ncurses` library
- Shell programming concepts, including command-line parsing, I/O redirection, environment variables, background job execution, and building a basic shell interpreter from scratch. 
- Multithreaded programming and synchronization with POSIX threads
- Inter-process communication using pipes and sockets

As a final team project, students were challenged to design and implement practical applications that integrate these systems programming concepts in a cohesive and creative way.
